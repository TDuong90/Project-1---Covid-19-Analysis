# Project-1: Covid-19 Analysis

Our very first project at UCI Data Analytics bootcamp.

Data were gathered from Johns Hopkins University.

In this group project we like to find answers for these three questions.

 1. Which state(CA vs. NY) followed the Stay-At-Home order better?
 2. What if both states did not implement a Stay-At-Home or social distancing order?
 3. Does the Stay-At-Home order affect air pollution in these two states? If so, is it a positive or negative effect?

## Tools used in this project: 

- Python libaries:
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Numpy 
  - Scipy.stats
  - Datetime
  - Pyplot

P.S. this is a reupload of group project. TEKM Team members: Eric Wu, Tan Duong, Karen Galindo Choudhary, Monte Rodriguez
